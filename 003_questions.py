120 Triangle

Given a triangle array, return the minimum path sum from top to bottom.

For each step, you may move to an adjacent number of the row below. More formally, if you are on index i on the current row, you may move to either index i or index i + 1 on the next row.

Example 1:

Input: triangle = [[2],[3,4],[6,5,7],[4,1,8,3]]
Output: 11
Explanation: The triangle looks like:
   2
  3 4
 6 5 7
4 1 8 3
The minimum path sum from top to bottom is 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 11 (underlined above).
Example 2:

Input: triangle = [[-10]]
Output: -10
 

Constraints:

1 <= triangle.length <= 200
triangle[0].length == 1
triangle[i].length == triangle[i - 1].length + 1
-104 <= triangle[i][j] <= 104

""" 
64. Minimum Path Sum

Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

example 1:
Input: grid = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]
Output: 7
Explanation: Because the path 1 → 3 → 1 → 1 → 1 minimizes the sum.


Example 2:

Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
Output: 12


solution :
dp
dp[i][j] = min (dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])
until 
m = i, n = j

63. Unique Paths II
You are given an m x n integer array grid. There is a robot initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

An obstacle and space are marked as 1 or 0 respectively in grid. A path that the robot takes cannot include any square that is an obstacle.

Return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

The testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.

example 1:
Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right


example 2:
Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,1],[0,0]]
Output: 1

""" 
5. Longest Palindromic Substring #

Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.

Example 1:

Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.

Example 2:

Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: "bb"

Example 3:

Input: s = "a"
Output: "a"

Example 4:

Input: s = "ac"
Output: "a"

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 1000
s consist of only digits and English letters (lower-case and/or upper-case),


solution 3:
1) brutal force
get every comb, an cal isPalindromic str

2) DP
